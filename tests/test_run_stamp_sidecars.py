"""Every downstream sidecar names the run that produced it.

Part one stamped the four extraction shards, where the caller knows the run.
A downstream stage does not: it is handed a shard directory, and its own
``dataset.run_id`` is whatever config it was launched with — a copied config
names a run it did not produce. So a sidecar inherits its run from the
extraction shard it sits beside, and these cases pin that.

The enumeration case is the one that keeps this true: it walks every public
writer in ``womblex.store`` and fails on one that is neither stamped here nor
in the exempt list below with a reason.
