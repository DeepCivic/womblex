"""The repository boundary, as a check rather than a convention.

The benchmark holds the womblex-collection ground truth and runs the suites
that score against it; this repository holds the code under test and receives
the reports. The failure that made this worth enforcing was not a missing rule
but a duplicated suite: two copies of the same scorer, one here and one there,
both writing the same file under ``docs/accuracy/``, so which numbers got
published depended on which was run last. They then drifted 81, 54 and 191
lines apart without either being wrong.

So the invariant is about *producers*, not about fixtures. A unit test reading
a document out of the vendored ``womblex-collection`` subset is fine — that
subset is vendored precisely so a bare clone can run the suite (see
THIRD_PARTY_DATA.md). Writing an accuracy report from here is not.

Limitation: this reads source text, so it catches a test that names the
directory, which is how you reach it in practice. A test that assembled the
path indirectly would slip past.
