"""The run record: what produced a run, observed from its own artefacts.

One case per acceptance criterion the mechanism can decide on its own — where
the record lives, that it regenerates from the shard directory alone and
reproduces apart from its timestamp, that stages are observed rather than
declared, that a model digest recomputes from the model files, that no
credential reaches the footer, and that a run predating the stamps is marked
partial rather than failing.

Shards are written through the real writer on the budget-statement DOCX
fixture, as `test_run_stamp` does.
