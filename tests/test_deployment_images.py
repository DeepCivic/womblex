"""The deployment-image audit still describes the compose files it audits.

`docs/deployment-images.md` records, per compose service, where its image comes
from. An audit is only worth having if it cannot go stale, so this reads the
document's tables back and holds them against the files themselves: the counts
it declares, a verdict on every service, and a `Kind`/`Reference` that still
says what compose says.

The failure this exists to catch is a service added later that builds from
source with nobody having decided it should — which looks like nothing at all
until a deployment cannot name what it is running.
