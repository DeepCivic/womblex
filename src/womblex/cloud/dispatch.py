"""Queue dispatch shared by the console and the service API (`docs/service-api.md`).

The two write actions that put work on the queue — plan an extraction run
(:func:`enqueue_extraction`) and dispatch a run's downstream stages
(:func:`enqueue_downstream_stages`) — plus the guard that refuses either when
a deployment lacks the store, ingest location or DSN they need. Extracted from
``womblex.ui.execute`` unchanged so a second caller reuses the same rules;
``ui.execute`` re-exports every name here.

Dispatch is always the queue. Nothing here shells out or runs a batch
in-process: it writes queue rows, and the workers a platform brings up do the
work. Execution needs both a remote store (to enqueue keys from and publish
shards to) and a job queue (to dispatch through); :func:`execution_status`
reports which piece is missing rather than half-working.
