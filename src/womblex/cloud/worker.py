"""Worker: launch DBOS, listen to the queues this process can serve, run until drained.

DBOS dequeues and runs the workflows in :mod:`womblex.cloud.workflows`; this
module decides which queues a process may listen to and when it stops. A worker
does not claim a job and hand it back: it simply never listens to a queue whose
work it cannot do. An extraction queue is named for the ingest root it reads,
so a worker wired to another root never sees that batch, and a stage queue is
joined only when the models the stage needs pass this worker's model check.

A stopped worker's unfinished workflows are recovered by DBOS when an executor
with the same id launches again, which is why the default id is the host name
and not the process id.
