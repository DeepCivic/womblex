"""The run board: enqueue work and read its progress, over DBOS workflow rows.

Replaces the ``womblex_jobs`` table. One workflow is one row of the old
board: an extraction batch (``kind='batch'``), or the coordinator that runs a
run's downstream stages in order (``kind='downstream'``) with one child
workflow per stage (``kind='stage'``). Workflow ids are deterministic
(``<run_id>:batch:0001``), so enqueueing twice attaches to the existing row
and a re-enqueue resumes a run rather than duplicating it.

Ownership travels as the ``owner`` workflow attribute. DBOS's own statuses are
mapped back to the board's vocabulary (``pending`` / ``running`` / ``done`` /
``failed``), which the API and console already speak.
