"""The DBOS workflows a worker runs: an extraction batch, a stage, and the coordinator.

An extraction batch stages its inputs from the ingest store, runs the shared
``womblex.batch.process_batch`` body (identical to ``womblex run``) and
publishes the shards. A stage plans its units (one per batch base, or one for
the whole run), then runs each as its own step, so a unit that finished is
recorded and a re-run starts after it. The coordinator waits for the run's
extraction to settle, then runs the requested stages in pipeline order.

Step results are storage keys, never data. The worker's config and stores are
process state (:func:`set_context`), not workflow arguments: arguments are
stored with the workflow, so they stay plain JSON-shaped values.
