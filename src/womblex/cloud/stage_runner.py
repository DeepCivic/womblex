"""Remote per-batch shard-stage runner — the generalisation of ``finalize``.

``womblex finalize`` is already store-aware in exactly the shape a downstream
stage needs: list one sidecar class under the run's shard prefix, download it to
a temp dir, call the unchanged library function against that ``Path``, upload
the result back. This module extends that shape from a single consolidation step
to the per-batch stages declared in :mod:`womblex.cloud.stage_contracts`.

Invariants:

- **Discovery is separate from required inputs.** Bases come from
  extraction-role siblings only; a downstream sidecar can never introduce one.
  Discovery-only files (``*.form_fields.parquet``) are never downloaded.
- **One unit of work at a time.** ``PER_BATCH`` stages stage exactly one base
  into a temp dir. Only ``quality`` is ``WHOLE_RUN``, because its dedup cluster
  ids are corpus-wide and per-batch execution would emit colliding ids.
- **All declared outputs publish, or none do.** A partial sidecar set can never
  read as complete on a later run.
- **Idempotent.** Completed bases skip on their published outputs, so re-running
  as more batches land processes only the new ones — the property ``finalize``
  already has, extended to every stage.

Stage *ordering* is the caller's: this runs one stage, it does not sequence them.
