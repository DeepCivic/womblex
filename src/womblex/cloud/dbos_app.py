"""DBOS wiring shared by the worker, the dispatchers and the read views.

One system database holds every run's progress: Postgres when a DSN is given,
a SQLite file otherwise, so a local run needs no database server. The names
here are the contract between the process that enqueues work (it only writes
workflow rows, through a :class:`dbos.DBOSClient`) and the worker that runs it.

Queues carry the routing that the retired job table did with ``release``:
an extraction queue is named for the ingest root it reads, and a stage queue
for the stage, so a worker listens only to the queues whose location and
models it can serve instead of claiming a job and handing it back.
