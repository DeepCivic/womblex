"""Named pre-configured pipelines the Pipeline Composer offers as starting points.

A *preset* is a partial :class:`~womblex.config.WomblexConfig` — the stage
toggles and stage settings for a common end-to-end shape — that the composer
form loads so an operator does not hand-assemble it section by section. It is
deliberately *partial*: ``dataset`` and ``paths`` name a real run and have no
sensible default (they are the one thing the operator must still supply), so a
preset never carries them. Merging a preset into the form's current config
therefore only ever flips stage `enabled` flags and their settings, leaving the
run's identity and filesystem paths untouched.

Presets are just data here for the same reason the DAG is: the composer's
validation and YAML download go through the same ``WomblexConfig(**raw)``
construction ``load_config`` uses, so a preset that would not load is a test
failure, not a runtime surprise (``tests/test_ui.py`` builds each one).

`DEFAULT-Isaacus` is the reference Isaacus pipeline:
``extract → normalise → spellfix → enrich → chunk → build_graph → embed →
money → link → done``, with text cleaning first (normalise + spellfix,
selected via ``processing.text_source``), the entity graph (enrich + the
``graph-refresh`` mention→chunk edge rebuild), chunk embeddings (the
kanon-2-embedder retrieval index), monetary amounts and entity links produced
over the one run. It targets PDF and DOCX sources — the two narrative formats
among ``SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS`` — which is what makes AI chunking and enrichment
meaningful (spreadsheets are structured, not narrative). The vendored demo run
(``run-throsby-demo``, ``womblex seed-demo``) is a completed run of exactly this
shape, so the console's sample corpus and the preset stay in step.

The runnable, CLI-first source of truth for that shape is
``configs/default-isaacus.yaml`` — a complete config plus the per-stage command
sequence a dev runs it with (``womblex run`` alone cannot: normalise, spellfix,
enrich, build_graph, money and link are per-stage commands, normalise/spellfix
run before enrich, and enrich must precede chunk). The overlay here mirrors
that file's stage toggles and settings; keep the two in step.

#: `DEFAULT-Isaacus` — extract → normalise → spellfix → enrich → chunk →
#: build_graph → embed → money → link.
#:
#: Mirrors ``configs/default-isaacus.yaml`` (the runnable, CLI-first source of
#: truth) and the vendored demo run (``run-throsby-demo``, which is a completed
#: run of this exact shape) — edit all three together. Settings beyond the bare
#: `enabled` flags are carried so the composer form seeds sensible values, not
#: just toggles:
#:
#: - `processing.text_source = spellfix` selects the OCR-repaired text layer
#:   (which chains on top of the normalised layer) as the single string BOTH
#:   enrich and chunk reassemble from. It is also the gate that puts `normalise`
#:   and `spellfix` into the downstream-stage dispatch: `normalise` has no
#:   `enabled` flag of its own, so `enabled_downstream_stages` treats it as
#:   wanted precisely when a consumer selects its layer (here, via spellfix).
#:   Both run BEFORE enrich in `PIPELINE_ORDER`, so the cleaned text is what
#:   enrichment and AI chunking see.
#: - `spellfix.enabled` runs the dictionary-gated OCR glyph repair; Tier A
#:   (digit→letter) only, en_AU dictionary — the defaults, carried explicitly so
#:   the form shows the stage as on.
#: - `chunking.chunking_model = kanon-2-enricher` selects semchunk-4 AI
#:   chunking (boundaries follow the enricher's structure). With `enrich` also
#:   on, `WomblexConfig` auto-enables `enrichment.persist_document` so `chunk`
#:   reuses the enrich Document rather than enriching twice — run enrich BEFORE
#:   chunk (docs/decisions.md). The resulting graph then gains its mention→chunk
#:   edges from the offline `graph-refresh` stage (the "build_graph" step).
#:   `chunk_size = 480` is the Kanon-2 window; `overlap = 0.1` shares 10% across
#:   boundaries so a mention straddling one still lands in a chunk.
#: - `embedding.enabled` vectorises the chunks with the kanon-2-embedder (the
#:   retrieval index), leaving `task`/`dimensions` at the model defaults. This
#:   is the stage the demo run carries (`*.embeddings.parquet`) and was the one
#:   the earlier preset omitted, so the sample corpus and the preset disagreed.
#: - `money.enabled` runs the offline amount annotator over the same run, so the
#:   graph and money sidecars land side by side (`graph + money over the one run`);
#:   `default_currency = AUD` matches Australian-government `$` convention.
#: - `linking.enabled` matches the enrichment entities to a corpus reference
#:   register. The register is corpus-specific and is NOT carried here (like
#:   `dataset`/`paths`, it names a real file): the operator supplies
#:   `linking.reference` at run time, and until they do the stage warns and
#:   no-ops. Enabling it without a reference still builds a valid `WomblexConfig`
#:   (there is no model-level requirement), so the preset stays loadable.
