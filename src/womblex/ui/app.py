    """Build the console app, bound to one run source for its lifetime.

    Exactly one of ``output_root`` / ``store_uri`` must be given;
    :class:`~womblex.ui.deps.UISettings` enforces that and raises
    ``ValueError`` otherwise. Binding at construction rather than per request
    is what keeps the run source out of the URL space — no endpoint can be
    talked into reading a directory the operator did not mount.

    ``feedback_dir`` overrides where local-mode report-action files land
    (default ``<output_root>/feedback``); see ``UISettings``. Ignored in
    remote mode, which always uses the store's own ``feedback/`` prefix.

    ``audit_only`` switches *off* the Execution Controls (docs/ui-plan.md
    merge 11): by default the console can dispatch, and pass ``audit_only``
    to get a pure auditing console whose ``/api/execute`` write action refuses
    with 403. Dispatch also requires a store and a queue — see
    :mod:`womblex.ui.execute`.

    ``db_dsn`` is the optional job queue the Dashboard reads. Omitted means
    no queue, which is a normal local deployment — the dashboard falls back
    to the run's own per-stage checkpoints.

    ``presets_dir`` is where the Pipeline Composer saves operator-authored
    presets (one JSON file each). Omitted disables saving — the built-in
    presets still serve, but ``POST /api/composer/presets`` refuses with 409.

    ``ingest_uri`` names where source documents arrive from (docs/ui-ingest-plan.md).
    Omitted, the Execution Controls cannot dispatch. Raises ``ValueError``
    when it is not disjoint from ``store_uri``'s effective ``runs/`` output.

    ``settings_dir`` holds an operator-saved location override. Stored on
    ``app.state`` as given — the *pre-overlay* base — so
    :func:`~womblex.ui.deps.get_settings` can apply the live override per
    request. Omitted, the location cards are read-only, exactly like preset
    saving without ``--presets-dir``.

    ``spa_dir`` is mounted only if it exists — a bare ``womblex[ui]`` install
    with no SvelteKit build alongside it still serves the read API, just
    without the frontend.
