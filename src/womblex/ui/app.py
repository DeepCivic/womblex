    ``ValueError`` otherwise. Binding at construction rather than per request
    is what keeps the run source out of the URL space — no endpoint can be
    talked into reading a directory the operator did not mount.

    ``feedback_dir`` overrides where local-mode report-action files land
    (default ``<output_root>/feedback``); see ``UISettings``. Ignored in
    remote mode, which always uses the store's own ``feedback/`` prefix.

    ``db_dsn`` is the optional job queue the Dashboard reads. Omitted means
    no queue, which is a normal local deployment — the dashboard falls back
    to the run's own per-stage checkpoints.
