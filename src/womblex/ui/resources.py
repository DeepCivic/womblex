"""The Resources Console's read model (docs/ui-plan.md merge 10).

Three connection cards, none backed by new detection logic — the plan's §3
row for this screen says connection *testing* already exists as library
code, so this module's job is only to call it and shape the answer for a
screen:

- **Run store** — `store/remote.is_remote_uri` / `storage_options_from_env`
  describe how the console is configured to reach state; the live
  reachability check is the same `RemoteStore.list_dirs` read
  `womblex.ui.dashboard` already performs to find checkpoints.
- **Job queue** — `womblex.ui.dashboard.queue_section` is reused rather than
  reimplemented: it is already "connect, read stats/workers/stale jobs,
  report a failure instead of raising", which is exactly what the queue
  card's fleet + queue-depth state needs.
- **Isaacus** — `utils.isaacus_client.unserved_models()` reports whether the
  configured deployment (hosted API or SageMaker) covers the models Womblex
  actually calls, with no network request of its own. `misconfigured_endpoints_var()`
  names a near-miss of `ISAACUS_SAGEMAKER_ENDPOINTS` (e.g. the singular
  `…_ENDPOINT`) so a silent hosted-API fallback reads as a fixable cause
  rather than a bare "No API key".

Credentials never appear in a response body: the store card reports whether
AWS keys are configured, not their values, and the Isaacus card masks the
API key to its last four characters.
