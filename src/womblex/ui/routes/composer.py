"""``/api/composer`` — the Pipeline Composer's graph, form schema, presets and
config validation (docs/ui-plan.md merge 9).

The read surface (`graph`, `schema`, `validate`, `yaml`, `GET /presets`) touches
no run and no filesystem — it builds a `WomblexConfig` in memory. Saving a
preset is the one write: `POST`/`DELETE /presets` file one JSON per preset —
under the store's own `presets/` prefix in remote mode (a sibling of `runs/`
and `feedback/`, so no writable mount), or a local `presets_dir`. They refuse
with 409 where the console cannot write (local mode with no presets dir), like
the Execution Controls without a queue. `readers` owns the local-vs-store
split, as it does for feedback.
