"""The order the pipeline's stages run in — declared once.

`StageContract` knows each stage's *inputs*, not its *place*. That is
deliberate (`run-stage` documents "ordering is yours to pick"), and it holds
because the one edge that matters most is not expressible as an input at all:
`chunk` reads `.enrichment_doc` only when `chunking.chunking_model` is set, so
enrich→chunk is config-derived and a topological sort over `required_inputs`
alone will happily put chunk first.

So the order has to be written down. It was — three times, in three places,
disagreeing: `STAGE_CONTRACTS`'s dict order, `store.retention.STAGE_SUFFIXES`
(commented "in pipeline order") and the README's command sequence. The first
two both ran chunk before enrich, and the console rendered its lifecycle
checkpoints in that order. This module is the README's sequence — the correct
one — as the single declaration the others now derive from.

`sort_by_pipeline` rather than an exported list of pairs, because every
consumer so far holds its own stage→something mapping (a sidecar suffix, a
checkpoint dirname) and wants that mapping ordered, not replaced.

#: irreversible and must not precede the stages that need the raw text.
#: `money` reads only extraction output, so its position is free; it sits with
#: the other offline stages. `quality` is last because it is the one
#: run-scoped stage: its duplicate-cluster ids are corpus-wide, so it is
