"""Service-availability checks used to gate optional pipeline stages.

Two distinct capabilities, deliberately kept apart:

- :func:`isaacus_available` — an Isaacus *API* deployment (hosted key or
  SageMaker). Gates the stages that actually call Kanon-2 at runtime: ``enrich``,
  ``embed``, and ``chunk`` **only when AI chunking is on** (``chunking_model``).
- :func:`tokenizer_available` — the chunk-*size* tokeniser can be loaded
  locally. Plain token chunking needs only this: the Kanon-2 tokeniser is
  vendored under ``_models/`` and runs fully offline (no API, no key), so a
  keyless local run can still chunk. The tokeniser is *distributed* via the
  Isaacus API/Hugging Face, but a bundled copy makes counting API-free at
  runtime — the distinction the old "tokeniser is API-only" framing collapsed.

    Plain (non-AI) chunking sizes chunks with a Hugging Face tokeniser, run
    entirely client-side. The Kanon-2 tokeniser is vendored under ``_models/``
    (or resolvable via ``WOMBLEX_MODELS_DIR``), so a keyless, air-gapped run can
    count tokens with no network and no API key. This checks that ``transformers``
    is importable and the named tokeniser resolves to a bundled directory —
    the pre-flight that lets the chunk stage proceed offline instead of gating
    on the Isaacus API.

    A callable token counter is always "available" — the caller supplies the
    counting logic itself, no model to load. A bare hub id that is *not*
    vendored returns ``False``: loading it would attempt a Hugging Face
    round-trip, which the local-first contract forbids at runtime; declare it
    unavailable rather than reach for the network.
