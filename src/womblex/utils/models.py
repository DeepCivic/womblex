"""Local model path resolution for offline / air-gapped deployment.

Roots are searched **per artefact**, in this order:

1. ``WOMBLEX_MODELS_DIR`` environment variable (explicit override).
2. ``_models/`` bundled inside the installed package — this is the path used
   after ``pip install womblex`` and is what makes air-gapped use viable.
3. ``models/`` sibling of ``src/`` — backward compatibility for editable
   installs and the historical repo layout.

Per artefact, not "first root wins", because the roots hold *different*
artefacts. A container image mounts the large ones (layout, embedding, OCR)
at ``WOMBLEX_MODELS_DIR=/app/models`` while the small ones (``en_AU``,
``kanon-2-tokenizer``) ship inside the wheel — so a single-root resolver makes
the override **shadow** the bundled artefacts rather than supplement them, and
``resolve_local_model_path("en_AU")`` starts returning the bare string.

Supports both HuggingFace hub-style cache layouts and flat model directories.

**Resolution is also the record of what a run loaded.** Which local models a
run used is not recoverable after the fact: nothing on disk says whether a
shard was OCR'd by one layout model or its replacement, and a model directory
is swapped in place far more often than it is renamed. So every resolution that
actually finds an artefact is recorded here, and the run stamp carries the
recorded set — name and content digest — into each Parquet footer as it is
written. `store/run_manifest.py` unions those per-file records into the run
record.

Recording at resolution rather than at load is deliberate: this is the one
choke point every model path in the library already goes through, so a new
model cannot be loaded without appearing in the record. A caller that is only
*probing* for a model it will not load passes ``record=False`` — the record
says what the run loaded, and a resolution that leads to no load would
overstate it.

Digests are over the artefact's bytes, so they recompute from the model files
alone, and they are taken lazily: a run that loads a model pays the hash once,
at the first file it writes afterwards, and a run that loads none pays nothing.
