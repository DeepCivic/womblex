"""Named model registry: one place that maps a config name to a model factory.

A *slot* is a place in the pipeline that takes a swappable model (OCR engine,
layout analyser, ...). Built-ins register under their existing names and
aliases; installed packages add more through an entry point in the group
``womblex.models.<slot>`` whose value is the factory itself, e.g.::

    [project.entry-points."womblex.models.ocr"]
    my-ocr = "my_pkg.ocr:make_reader"

A factory may carry a ``womblex_traits`` dict (for example
``{"markdown": True}`` on an OCR factory whose reader returns page markdown).
Config names registered models only: an unknown name is an error listing the
known names, and anything shaped like an import path is refused outright.
