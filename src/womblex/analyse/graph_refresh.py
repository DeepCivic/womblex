"""Offline graph-edge refresh: rebuild mention→chunk edges after chunking.

The corpus asset chunks *after* enriching (AI chunking reuses the persisted
ILGS Document), so the ``*.graph_edges.parquet`` written at enrich time cannot
carry mention→chunk edges — no chunks existed yet — and the
``*.enrichment_entities.parquet`` mentions all have ``chunk_index = -1``. This
stage closes that gap once chunks exist.

Both inputs carry character offsets into the same reassembled narrative
(entity mention spans; chunk ``start_char``/``end_char``), so the refresh is
**deterministic and API-free**: for every entity mention it finds the
overlapping narrative chunk(s) and

- rewrites the entities sidecar with ``chunk_index`` populated (first
  overlapping chunk, matching the enrich-time semantics), and
- rewrites the graph-edges sidecar, replacing any ``mentioned_in`` edges with
  freshly computed entity→chunk edges (all other edges — hierarchy,
  citations, cross-references — are preserved untouched).

Idempotent: recomputing from the same offsets yields the same result, so a
re-run (or a resume) is safe. Steps 3 and 5 of the product consume the
refreshed graph. Only entity mentions are (re)linked — segment/cross-reference
chunk edges need the full ``EnrichmentResult`` and are out of scope here.
