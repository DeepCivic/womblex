"""Re-export shim for the remaining (non-PDF) extraction strategies.

PDFs route through `extract_pdf_with_plan` (per-page profile + orchestrator)
rather than dedicated strategy classes, and so do standalone images — this
shim exposes only the file-format extractors for callers that still import
from `womblex.ingest.strategies`.
