"""Backend-neutral PDF types — the seam every extractor is written against.

No third-party imports at runtime, deliberately: importing this module must not
pull in a PDF backend or numpy. ``numpy`` appears under ``TYPE_CHECKING`` only,
for ``Page.render``'s annotation.

Two conventions the adapters own, so no caller has to:

- **Coordinates** are PDF points, origin at the page's top-left, y growing
  downward (MuPDF's convention). A backend whose native convention differs —
  pdfium's y grows upward — converts in its adapter.
- **Shapes are typed, not backend-shaped.** ``text_dict`` yields ``Block``
  rather than a nested dict, ``find_tables`` yields ``FoundTable`` rather than
  something with an ``extract()`` method, ``render`` yields an array rather
  than a pixmap. ``Word`` is the one exception: it stays tuple-shaped because
  ``grid_projection`` slices it positionally.
