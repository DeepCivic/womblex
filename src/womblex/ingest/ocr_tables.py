"""OCR table feeder: reconstruct cells inside a layout-detected table rect.

The second feeder of the shared ``table_grid`` algorithm (the first is
``spreadsheet_print``). An OCR quad reduces exactly to a ``Span``; the
lifted binning/clustering then infers the grid. Round 1 targets flat,
clean contemporary tables — ``reconstruct_table`` returns ``None`` (never
a partial) whenever the grid fails its precision gates, so refusal on a
hard shape is a correct outcome. See
docs/table-cell-reconstruction-plan.md (A1).

All coordinates here are image pixels at the caller's render dpi; the
point-space ``table_grid`` tolerances are scaled by ``dpi / 72``.

# tables (dense_text_548: 0.45) and non-tables the detector or a whole-page
# rect fed in (FUNSD forms 0.38-0.41, diverse_layout_49 0.49) — all fall
# well below. 0.75 sits in the empty gap between the two populations.
