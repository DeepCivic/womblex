"""Per-stage layout over an existing shard directory (``run-stage layout``).

Re-runs the batch's layout step against the source documents and replaces each
batch's ``*.layout_regions.parquet``. Elements, tables and redaction results
stay as extracted: nothing reads layout after extraction, so a rerun is a way to
measure a model, not to change what was built (applying a new model to tables or
redaction is a re-extract). The sidecar's own fingerprint, compared with the
elements footer's, says whether the two still agree
(:func:`womblex.store.layout_output.layout_fingerprint_status`).

Skip rule: a batch whose sidecar already carries this config's fingerprint is
left alone; a changed model, option, dpi or page scope reruns it. ``force``
reruns regardless.

Sources come back through :class:`SourceResolver`, the first downstream stage to
need them. A batch is written only if every document in it was analysed, so a
sidecar is never half old model and half new; one that could not be analysed is
logged with its source hash and the batch is counted failed.
