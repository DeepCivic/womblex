"""Round-trip a reviewer-corrected baseline back to element-keyed corrections.

:mod:`womblex.process.renderer` projects a segment's element run *forward*
into the markdown a human reads and corrects. This module is the reverse:
given the original element run and the (possibly edited) markdown, it
attributes each corrected block back to the element it was rendered from,
so ground truth is stored keyed to element identity — not to a rendering
that reading-order and formatting changes regenerate.

The two directions share one coordinate: the renderer separates every
contributing element with exactly one blank line
(:data:`~womblex.process.chunker.NARRATIVE_JOIN`), the only element
delimiter in its closed structural set, so

    ``render_elements(run) == NARRATIVE_JOIN.join(one block per contributing element)``

holds for any run whose element blocks carry no blank line of their own —
which the renderer's design already assumes (tables join rows with a
single newline, forms join fields the same way, and a narrative element
that carried a blank line would give a reviewer no way to see the element
boundary either). :func:`split_rendered` therefore recovers the blocks by
splitting on that delimiter and pairing them with the contributing
elements in output order. A reviewer who changes the *number* of blocks —
merging two paragraphs or splitting one — has changed element structure,
which an element-keyed store cannot represent without re-segmentation, so
that is a :class:`RoundTripError` rather than a silent re-attribution.

:func:`apply_corrections` returns corrected copies of the elements: a
narrative element carries its corrected text, a ``table`` its corrected
cells (parsed back from the GFM grid, so a later table-markdown format
re-renders correctly), a ``form`` its corrected fields. Re-rendering is
then the unchanged :func:`~womblex.process.renderer.render_elements` over
those copies in whatever order is wanted — each element still carries the
text stored against its identity, so a changed element order moves the
blocks without reassigning their text.
