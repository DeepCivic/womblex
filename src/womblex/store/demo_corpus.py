"""Publish the vendored demo run into a console's run store.

A fresh console — local or store-backed — points at an empty run source and
shows "no runs" until a real pipeline has landed one. That is a poor first
impression for an operator evaluating the console, and the cause of the
cloud-deployment "Sample corpus not present": the store (`s3://redline`) was
simply empty.

`output/console-demo/run-throsby-demo/` is a complete, pre-built pipeline run
(extract → chunk → enrich → embed → money, checkpoints included) vendored into
the repo/image. This module copies it into whatever store the console reads —
a local `output_root` or an `s3://` bucket — under `runs/<run_id>/`, so a
fresh deployment has a browsable sample corpus with one command
(`womblex seed-demo`). It is store-layout knowledge, so it lives beside the
other `store/` publishers rather than in the CLI.

The publish is one code path for both deployments: `RemoteStore.from_uri`
returns a local `LocalFileSystem` for a bare path / `file://` and an
`S3FileSystem` for `s3://`, and `upload_file` writes through either.

    *prefix* is the store-relative dir the run sits under, and it differs by
