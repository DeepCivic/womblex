"""Run-level document manifest consolidation.

The per-batch ``batch-NNNN._manifest.parquet`` sidecars are the only
mapping from ``source_hash`` (the join key on every other sidecar) back
to the source document (``doc_id`` / ``filename``). Consumers of a
shipped run need that mapping in one place, so the end of ``womblex run``
— and the standalone ``womblex manifest`` command — consolidate them
into a single ``manifest.parquet`` at the run root, one row per document
(``MANIFEST_SCHEMA``).

**It also carries the run record** — what produced the run, in the file's own
footer key-value metadata. Footer rather than columns because the record is run
grain and the manifest is document grain, which is the rule ``decisions.md``
already states for run- and corpus-shaped provenance; this file rather than a
new one because consolidation is already the moment both finalisation paths
pass through and is already regenerable on demand, which is exactly the
lifecycle the record needs.

Everything in it is **observed, not declared**. The stages are read from the
run stamps the files themselves carry, so a stage that was configured and never
ran is absent while one that ran and produced nothing is present with no rows —
a distinction a list taken from configuration flags cannot make. The local
models are the union of what each file recorded loading. The documents,
extraction methods and statuses are counted off the consolidated rows. Nothing
is taken from a configuration file, because ``womblex manifest`` may be re-run
long after the run and against a configuration that has since moved on.

What cannot be established is named rather than omitted or invented: a run
finalised before the stamps existed produces a record whose ``partial`` list
says so, instead of a record that quietly claims a run had no stages.

Attribution, not reproduction. Outputs are not bit-reproducible — OCR and model
variability mean two runs over one corpus differ — so the record inventories
what a run did and never promises the run can be recomputed from it.
