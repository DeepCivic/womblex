"""The evidence reference: one shape for "where in the source this came from".

Every annotation sidecar that marks a span of source text (money, entity links,
PII) carries these columns in place of an anchor of its own, so a consumer
resolves any of them the same way. A row never carries a null receipt: it says
how precisely it is located, in ``anchor_level``, and carries the most precise
location that is reliable.

==============  ============================================================
``anchor_level``  what the row is located to, and what a check can say
==============  ============================================================
``span``        ``char_start`` / ``char_end`` index the text named by
                ``text_layer``; the source slice equals the span's text
``element``     ``elem_order`` (and ``cell_row`` / ``cell_col`` or ``sheet``
                for a cell); the span's text lies within that element or cell
``chunk``       the chunk the row names (``chunk_index``), with its pages and,
                for a table chunk, the table via ``elem_order``; the span's
                text lies within that chunk
``document``    the document only; the span's text lies within its narrative
                or one of its table markdowns
==============  ============================================================

``text_layer`` says what the offsets of a ``span`` row index: ``elements`` /
``normalised`` / ``spellfix`` (the narrative under that element-text layer, the
space chunks and enrichment mentions use), ``table_markdown`` (the markdown of
the table ``elem_order``, or of the sheet ``sheet``) or ``cell`` (one cell's
value). A position is never searched for: offsets are carried from where they
were computed, or the row is given a coarser level.
