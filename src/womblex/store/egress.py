"""Bundle builder: export one finalised local run into an egress bundle.

The producer half of ``docs/egress-bundle-contract.review.md``: Womblex writes
the bundle and stops — no retention, serving, versioning, or auth.

``build_bundle`` takes a finished local run (``<run_root>/documents/`` — every
file it contains, recursively, not only its top-level ``*.parquet`` shards —
plus its consolidated ``<run_root>/manifest.parquet``, as
:func:`womblex.store.run_manifest.write_run_manifest` produces) and a
destination :class:`~womblex.store.remote.RemoteStore`, and writes::

    <dest>/<run_id>/
      corpus/                     # documents/ mirrored recursively + manifest.parquet
      sources/<source_hash><ext>  # raw files, deduplicated by hash
      source_index.parquet        # source_hash -> raw key, ext, doc_id, filename, status
      egress_manifest.json        # bundle descriptor + per-document resolution report

Resolution reuses :class:`~womblex.store.source_resolver.SourceResolver`, so
``source_index.parquet`` carries its four-status vocabulary plus one more of
this module's own: ``upload_failed``, for a source that resolved but whose
copy to the destination raised — isolated per source so one bad upload does
not abort the export (``source_index.parquet`` and ``egress_manifest.json``
still get written). Every write is a ``RemoteStore.upload_file`` off a local
path, so a local directory and an object-store URI are one code path. Scoped
to a local run, as ``SourceResolver`` is: a distributed run is staged locally
first.

Re-exporting into a bundle folder that already has a ``sources/`` directory
(a re-run over an updated corpus) removes any file under it that the new
export did not just write or attempt to write — so a document dropped from
the manifest since the last export does not linger as an orphaned raw file
``source_index.parquet`` no longer lists. A source this export attempted but
failed to upload is left untouched either way, since its destination content
is of unknown provenance.
