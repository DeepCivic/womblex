"""Resolve a published row back to the source document it describes.

Every sidecar in a run joins on ``source_hash``, and the manifest is the only
mapping from that key back to a document — but a manifest row names a corpus
and a path, not a file that is known to still be there. This closes the loop:
given a run's manifest and access to the corpus, hand it a ``source_hash`` and
it returns the file, having verified the bytes, or says precisely why it cannot.

**Every call returns a** :class:`Resolution` — a status and a reason, never an
empty return and never an exception — so a consumer walking a run's rows gets
an account of the ones that failed rather than a truncated list.

**Two hash bases, and the resolver knows which it faces.** A file ingest hashes
the source bytes (``store/output.py``); the pre-extracted records path hashes
the record id plus its text (``ingest/records.py``), where there is no file to
hash. Records rows are therefore declined by name, naming
``*.provenance.parquet`` as the back-link that does answer for them — out of
scope for this resolver, which is not the same as missing.

**Root + relpath, so a corpus that moves re-resolves.** Resolution is by the
path under the ingest root that P1 records and then by content hash, never by
an absolute path, so a moved corpus re-resolves against its new root unchanged.

**The index is the run's own enumeration.** Both paths go through
``select_supported`` in ``cli/_shared.py``, the one rule every entry point
ingests by, so a document returned here is one a run could have processed and a
corpus refused here is one a run refuses too — agreement by construction rather
than by a second walk that happens to match.

Scoped to the NLP path. The standalone register ingests (G-NAF, ABN,
geospatial) carry no ``source_hash`` and are not addressed here.
