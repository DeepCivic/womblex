"""Run directories: generate, list, describe, and purge.

Each pipeline run writes its outputs under ``<output_root>/<run_id>/`` and
its checkpoint state under ``<checkpoint_dir>/<run_id>/``. Multiple runs
co-exist for stage-vs-stage comparison; retention controls how many old
runs are kept on disk.

:func:`describe_run` summarises a single run — document count, which stages
have run, timestamps — for a run selector. It reads only artefacts the
pipeline already writes and never mutates a run.

Two policies:

- ``rolling`` — keep the ``keep`` most-recent runs (including current),
  purge older. Default ``keep=2`` (current + previous).
- ``keep_all`` — disable auto-purge; the user manages purges manually.

The current run is *always* preserved regardless of policy or position.
Retention is normally applied at the start of a new run, before any
output is written.
